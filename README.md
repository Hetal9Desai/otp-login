## Phone OTP Login React App

This is a React-based application that demonstrates a phone number verification flow using OTP (One-Time Password). It includes phone number input, OTP input, OTP timer, error handling for invalid OTP, and the ability to resend OTP when expired.

## Features

Phone Number Input: Allows users to enter their phone numbers to initiate the OTP process.

OTP Input Fields: Once the phone number is validated, OTP input fields appear, where users can enter the OTP sent to their phone.

OTP Timer: The OTP expires after a set time (60 seconds), and a countdown timer is shown.

Resend OTP: Users can request to resend the OTP if the timer expires.

OTP Validation: The OTP entered by the user is validated against a pre-defined OTP.

Error Handling: If the user enters an incorrect OTP, an error message is displayed.

Responsive Design: The app is designed to work well on both mobile and desktop screens.
